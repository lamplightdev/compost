# compost

> A collection of small Web Component mixins to add commonly required functionality without the bloat

- **No dependencies** just mixin and go
- **Plain old JavaScript** no build tools required, compatible by default, debug in the browser with standard dev tools
- **No magic** straight forward to understand
- **Small & efficient** low overhead to keep your components lean
- **Include only what you need** take it or leave it
- **Cross browser** works on all modern browsers and IE11

## Install

Install using [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```sh
npm install --save @lamplightdev/compost
```

## Mixins

### CompostShadowMixin

Adds a shadow DOM to your component. Takes a string returned from a `render()` method to set up the shadow DOM, and adds [ShadyCSS](https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss) support if the polyfill is included for browsers that don't natively support shadow DOM. Also adds some convenience accessors for querying shadow DOM elements.

### CompostPropertiesMixin

Lets you specify your component's properties upfront, their types, whether their value should be reflected in an attribute, and an observer function to run when the property changes.

### CompostEventsMixin

Let's you add declarative event binding in your templates. Also adds some convenience methods for manual event binding and firing.

### CompostRepeatMixin

Stamps out a template for each object in the `items` array property.

### CompostMixin

A convenience mixin that includes `CompostShadowMixin`, `CompostPropertiesMixin`, and `CompostEventsMixin`:

```js
const CompostMixin = (parent) => {
  return class extends
    CompostEventsMixin(
      CompostPropertiesMixin(
        CompostShadowMixin(parent))) {}
};
```

### Where's the data binding?

There is none. For simple, well structured components there's not always a need for data binding - turns out you can get a lot done with the standard DOM APIs (and it's the most efficient way to update the DOM too). But if data binding is your thing, you can simply extend `CompostShadowBaseMixin` to include your data binding library of choice (I like [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html))

## Usage

### CompostShadowMixin

```html

<x-app></x-app>

<script>
  class App extends CompostMixin(HTMLElement) {
    render() {
      return `
        <style>
          :host {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            max-width: 1280px;
            margin: 0 auto;
          }
        </style>

        <button class="button" id="buttonEat">Eat me</button>
        <button class="button" id="buttonDrink">Drink me</button>
        <button class="button" id="buttonClick">Click me</button>
      `;
    }
  }

  customElements.define('x-app', App);
  
  const app = document.querySelector('x-app');
</script>
```
Your x-app component now has a shadow DOM with encapsulated CSS.

> ```app.$s``` is a reference to the shadow DOM

> ```app.$``` is equivalent to ```app.shadowRoot.querySelector```

> ```app.$$``` is equivalent to ```app.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll```

> ```app.$id``` is an object containing a mapping of all elements with their `id`


### CompostPropertiesMixin

### CompostEventsMixin

### CompostRepeatMixin
